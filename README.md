# Text Adventure Game
I decided to make a simple TAG for my mom's birthday using just JavaScript (since I've started using JS a lot more lately).
Users can type commands in the text box below the SVG element.
Instead of picking up prizes with points, players will pick up pictures, which will result in a photo album.
